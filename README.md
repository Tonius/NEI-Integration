NEI-Integration
===============

# This Project is unmaintained please use for 1.12.2 and above:https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei-integration

NEI Integration is two things-- a playground to try out new types of NEI handlers, and a place to put NEI handlers if I somehow can't get them into the mods they were made for. The mod aims to stimulate other mod developers to add NEI handlers to their own mods.  
  
### Requests
Requests for additional NEI handlers will gladly be accepted. Just create an issue, and I'll see what I can do.  
  
### For mod authors
If you are a mod author and want to migrate some of these handlers to your mod, please do so! That's one of my goals. Just try to follow these guidelines:
- Tell me. We don't want duplicate NEI handlers, do we?
- Credit me somewhere. Maybe even link to this mod, but it's not required.

Alternatively, if your mod is open source, you could just ask me to do a pull request.
